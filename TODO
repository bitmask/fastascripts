+ "facat"
  nu
  pr
    get rid of spaces in fasta ids and
    optionally add a prefix before each fasta id

+ "fagrep"
  nu
  pr
    retains all fasta entries containing the query; matches can be inexact; can take input from a queryfile

+ fagrepif
  nu
    grep in frame for a codon
    - could take a frameshift parameter

- fastandard replaces "faunamb"
remove N 
  nu    
    prints fasta file containing only entries with standard nucleotides
    - needs getopt
    -- fastq should take max 2 Ns
    don't know why unamb is replacing ambiguous bases with bases - I'm not sure why you would want to do this, or if you really do, you shouldn't bias your sequence as this was doing previously, so I have removed the functionality

- fasplit
itemize fasta
  nu
  pr
    split fasta file into a file for each gene

- famerge
fasta merge
  nu
  pr
    merges fasta entries that contain the same gene name (exons)

+ fatrans
fasta translate
  nu -> pr
    translates nucleotide to protein fasta
    - contains codon manipulation subroutines
    
- fawindow should be merged from "fakmer"
sliding window
  nu
  pr
    extract window or windows from each entry in the fasta file
    - add ability to just extract a region

+ fagff
  nu
  pr?
    extract segments from a gff file to generate a new fasta file with just the given segments
    also works with alignments, and will disregard alignment characters (-) to select the correct nucleotides for each segment

+ faannotate
  nu
  pr
    given a tab delimited file containing the fasta id or part of it, and data that should be added into the fasta file, add it
    this also works with .tre trees, but should fix the parsing of fasta files
